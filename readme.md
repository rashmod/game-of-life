# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

## Rules

1. If cell is alive with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
2. If cell is alive with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. If cell is alive with two or three neighbors survives.
4. If cell is dead with three neighbors becomes populated.

## Actions

-   Click to Change state of cell
-   Hold Click and move mouse to draw
-   Click Pause to pause app
-   Click Play to play
-   Click Randomize to randomize cell state
-   Click Reset to reset all cell to dead
